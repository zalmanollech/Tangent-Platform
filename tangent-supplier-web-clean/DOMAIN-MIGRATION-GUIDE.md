  // Add more team members as needed
],
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add/update these environment variables:

```bash
# Security
PLATFORM_ACCESS_KEY=your-super-secret-platform-key-here

# Domain (update when you configure custom domain)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,https://www.your-domain.com

# Existing variables (keep these)

## üöÄ **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Configure DNS (Choose Option A or B)**

#### **For Option A (Single Domain):**

CNAME Record: www.your-domain.com ‚Üí your-domain.com
```

#### **For Option B (Subdomains):**
```
A Record:     your-domain.com ‚Üí Railway IP
CNAME Record: www.your-domain.com ‚Üí your-domain.com
CNAME Record: platform.your-domain.com ‚Üí your-railway-app.railway.app
CNAME Record: admin.your-domain.com ‚Üí your-railway-app.railway.app
```

### **Step 2: Update Railway Configuration**

1. **Add Custom Domain in Railway:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your custom domain(s)

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,https://www.your-domain.com,https://platform.your-domain.com
   ```

### **Step 3: Deploy Updated Code**

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add domain migration and access control"
git push origin main

# Railway will automatically redeploy
```

### **Step 4: Test Access Control**

1. **Test Public Access:**
   - Visit `https://your-domain.com`
   - Should see professional landing page
   - Try clicking "Team Access" ‚Üí should require credentials

2. **Test Platform Access:**
   - Try visiting `https://your-domain.com/portal` without login
   - Should redirect to landing page with access denied message
   - Sign in with team credentials ‚Üí should access platform

3. **Test Team Access:**
   - Sign in with authorized team email ‚Üí should work
   - Try with non-authorized email ‚Üí should be denied

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "Platform access denied" for team member**

**Solution:** Add their email to `config.platform-access.js`:
```javascript
authorizedUsers: [
  'existing@emails.com',
  'new-team-member@company.com',  // ‚Üê Add this
],
```

### **Issue: Public can still access platform**

**Solution:** Check that access control middleware is properly loaded:
1. Verify `lib/access-control.js` exists
2. Check server.js includes: `app.use(routeHandler);`
3. Restart the application

### **Issue: Domain not working**

**Solution:** 
1. Check DNS propagation: `nslookup your-domain.com`
2. Verify Railway domain configuration
3. Check SSL certificate status in Railway

### **Issue: CORS errors after domain change**

**Solution:** Update CORS origins in Railway environment:
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,https://www.your-domain.com
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features Implemented**

### **Multi-Layer Protection:**

1. **Route-Level Protection:**
   - `/portal/*` ‚Üí Requires authentication + authorization
   - `/admin/*` ‚Üí Requires authentication + authorization  
   - `/api/*` ‚Üí Requires authentication + authorization

2. **User Authorization:**
   - JWT token validation
   - Email whitelist checking
   - Role-based access control

3. **Admin Override:**
   - Emergency access with `PLATFORM_ACCESS_KEY`
   - For troubleshooting and emergency situations

4. **Audit Logging:**
   - All unauthorized access attempts logged
   - Security events tracked
   - Failed login attempts monitored

### **What Happens When Unauthorized User Tries to Access Platform:**

```
1. User visits /portal
2. System checks for valid JWT token
3. If no token ‚Üí Redirect to landing page
4. If token exists ‚Üí Verify email is authorized
5. If not authorized ‚Üí Redirect to landing page with message
6. If authorized ‚Üí Allow access to platform
```

   ],
   ```

2. **Deploy update:**
   ```bash
   git add config.platform-access.js
   git commit -m "Add new team member access"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Remove Team Member:**

1. **Remove from configuration:**
   ```javascript
   // Remove their email from authorizedUsers array
   ```

2. **Deploy update** (same as above)

### **Emergency Access:**

If you need to give someone temporary access without code deployment:

```bash
# They can add this to their request:
